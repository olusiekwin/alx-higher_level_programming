# 0x13. JavaScript - Objects, Scopes, and Closures

## Description
This repository contains solutions for the tasks related to the "0x13. JavaScript - Objects, Scopes, and Closures" project. The project aims to reinforce knowledge of JavaScript objects, scopes, and closures. It covers fundamental concepts such as creating objects, understanding the 'this' keyword, dealing with undefined, variable type, and scope importance. Additionally, the project delves into closures, prototypes, and object inheritance.
